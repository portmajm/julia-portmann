I'm Julia, a first year PhD student at the Yale School of the Environment working in the Skelly lab! I graduated from Washington College in 2019 with a B.S. in Biology and Environmental Science, followed by a year of assorted AmeriCorps programs. During this time, I worked with numerous taxa including birds, mammals, macroinvertebrates, fish, plants, and more! In 2022, I graduated from James Madison University with a M.S. in Biology. My research there assessed stream restoration in the Chesapeake Bay watershed using biotic stream condition indicators and their relationship with surrounding land use. Following this, I completed two terms with the NASA DEVELOP program, taught as an adjunct at the University of New Haven, then joined the Map of Life in Yale's Center for Biodiversity and Global Change as a research associate. Now, I am looking forward to combining my large data skills with freshwater field experience to explore freshwater communities in the context of aquatic connectivity, land use change, and climate impacts.
